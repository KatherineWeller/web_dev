	<h1>Opinion: Call of Duty Updates Too Frequently</h1>
	
	<div>
	<img src="img_src/fun_update.jpg" width="400" height="250">

	<p>
		The update i'm currently watching is 21 GB... why do I need to download >20 GB worth of content every single time I open the game?
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3><strong><em>There isn't even a significant difference after the update.</em></strong></h3>

	<h2>Problems with this:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I have to schedule playing to allow for ~1 hr worth of download time before I can even hop into a game.</li>
		<li>The Playstation 4 has 500 GB of memory, this game already accounts for ~100 GB of that memory. </li>
			<ul><strong>This takes away from space for other games.</strong></ul>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Maybe this is just how games are going to operate now, as the players demand ever-updating content and developers work to keep audiences engaged. </p>
